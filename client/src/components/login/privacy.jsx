          <h5>Do we use "cookies"?</h5>
          <p>
            Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer&apos;s hard drive through your Web
            browser (if you allow) that enables the site&apos;s or service provider&apos;s systems to recognize your browser and capture and
            remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping
            cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables
            us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and
            site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We use cookies to:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Understand and save users&apos; preferences for future visits.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
            You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser&apos;s Help Menu to learn
            the correct way to modify your cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If users disable cookies in their browser:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h5>Third-party disclosure</h5>
          <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide
            users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating
            our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
            We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or
            protect ours or others&apos; rights, property, or safety.
          </p>
          <p> 
            However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising,
            or other uses. 
          </p>
          <h5>Third-party links</h5>
          <p>
            Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party
            sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content
            and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback
            about these sites.
          </p>
          <h5>Google</h5>
          <p>
            Google&apos;s advertising requirements can be summed up by <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">Google&apos;s Advertising Principles</a>. They are put in place to provide
            a positive experience for users.
          </p>
          <p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
          <h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children&apos;s Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States&apos; consumer protection
            agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&apos;s
            privacy and safety online.
          </p>
          <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
          <p>We do not let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13.</p>
          <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
            have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
            Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
            personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach
              occur:
            </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We will notify you via email within 1 business day.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
            rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
            have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies
            to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
          </p>
          <h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>
          <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
            recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
              </li>

                Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
